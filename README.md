# Berry Playground

This repo and the corresponding [discussions](https://github.com/tasmota/Berry_playground/discussions) have been created to help Tasmota Berry code developers.

The repo is in its infancy (6/4/23) so not surprisingly there are not a lot of contributions yet.  This is where you come in!

## Discussions

By creating this repo "Discussions" was also created.  Now Berry developers have another place to ask questions, get help, and make contributions as regards Tasmota Berry coding.

https://github.com/tasmota/Berry_playground/discussions


Alternatively you might try

* [Tasmota Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/tasmota/) - general tasmota questions (but you can try asking Berry questions here)
* [Tasmota Berry Discord](https://discord.gg/PsAnzqZT) - ( this is where Tasmota Berry dev's hang out so limit your use to when you can get no love here)


## Contributions

### Repo Main Folders

The repo consists of five primary subfolders of contributions.  Within each are folders of contributions each containing a README.md file explaining their content and now to use them.

* [developer-tools](developer-tools/README.md)  -  any developer tools that help us to do tasmota berry coding.
* [modules](modules/README.md) -  ready to go modules that can be downloaded and incorporated into an app or driver
* [app](apps/readme.md)  -  Full blown, complete, ready to go applications
* [drivers](drivers/readme.md)  - fully functional driver contributions      
* [tutorial-code-blocks](tutorial-code-blocks) - tutorial-code-blocks How To's each focusing on a single coding challenge

### Downloading 

Each README.md file of a contribution (folder) should contain a link so you can download directly the contribution folder without having to clone the whole repo.  

### Contributing

If you want to make a contribution (i.e. a folder of code) then follow these steps

1. Start a discussion topic in the [discussions](https://github.com/tasmota/Berry_playground/discussions) category corresponding to the primary subfolder where you think your contribution will be best placed.
2. Fork the repo then clone your fork to your dev machine.
3. Add your contribution folder under the appropriate primary subfolder (see above)
4. Make sure to edit the parent README.md file with a link to you contribution README.md
5. Make sure your folder adheres to the guide below
6. Push your committed changes back to your fork at your GitHub account

**Folder Guide**

your contributed folder needs to have a README.md file
  
  in the README.md file you need at least
  
  * a link to download your folder.  [see how](https://github.com/tasmota/Berry_playground/discussions/13)
  * a clear explanation of the files in your contribution and how to use them
  * a link back to the parent README.md file  `[return](../README.md)`
  * for code blocks there is no Berry language syntax highlighting but if you choose ` ```javascript ` you get some appropriate highlighting
