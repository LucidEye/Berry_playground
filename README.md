# Berry Playground

Dec 4, 2020

This will be the repo for Berry Enthusiasts (specifically Tasmota Berry) to share the code, drivers, apps, and experience they have developed with the community. 

If you watch the repo now you'll know when it's ready to receive pull requests with links to your repos, gists and webpages.   

Should be ready for primetime by Christmas.
