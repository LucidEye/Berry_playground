## Files in this folder relate to the use of Google API from Tasmota.

The google API documentation is not great - it's quite hard to find out how to use it without using a library.

Feel free to add example usage for and google APIs in this folder.

### Files:

#### [gdrivepics.be](./gdrivepics.be)

Grab pictures from a prototype modified webcam driver, and save them to Google Drive.  Uses bytes referencing native memory in Tas to grab image files as jpeg, and write them to a subfolder of the shared folder in google drive.

Very prototype; may soon be updated to be a timelpase capture and  motion sensing capture in one.
